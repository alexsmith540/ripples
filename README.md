ヽ༼இل͜இ༽ﾉ Ripples!

I had a quick hour and wanted to look at a curiosity:
What happens if I plot a group of sound oscillators in 3d space (around the listener) arranged as such that each frequency would reach the center at the same time.
For further curiosity: 
I make a polar opposite (positioned) tone with a binaural difference based on Schumann resonance fundamental 7.83hz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances)

The scales for the frequencies:
I use the solfeggio frequencies, which there are a ton of various hippy literatures about on google. I grabbed an array of them from a google image search...
