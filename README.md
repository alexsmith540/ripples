I had a quick hour and wanted to look at a curiosity:
What happens if I plot a group of sound oscillators in 3d space (around the listener) arranged as such that each frequency would reach the center at the same time.
For further curiosity: 
I make a polar opposite (positioned) tone with a binaural difference based on Schumann resonance fundamental 7.83hz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances)

The scales for the frequencies:
I use the solfeggio frequencies, which there are a ton of various hippy literatures about on google. I grabbed an array of them from a google image search...

The low group and high group of tones you hear are scaled based on the Schumann resonance. Oddly enough, scaling my tone groups based on Schumann resonances (and ultimately setting position) responsible for making all the tones hit the center (the listener) at the same time.
